Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.


Vivek Babu
Dynamic Programming
- It is one of the most useful problem solving technique
- The problems that seem to be very tough can be broken down into smaller subprobems and then the solution becomes very easy
- DP with memoisation makes use of recursion which allows us to visualize the problems better
